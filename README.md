###Ãœber sbt template###

#### G8 & Go ####

**A highly opionated sbt template with tons of nice plugins, an admin console and dependencies ready to go!**

####Motivation####

* Easy way to upgrade libraries, easy access all the libraries (I use, but I expect to include more).
* Since I use less than 20-30 libraries in my projects, actually having dependency listing part of template. This way it is both more readable and dependencies are autocompletable.
* A console (since I go down into the console a lot). Basically any method you add to AdminConsole, you can call directly from console without having to import anything
* Latest version of sbt + sbt plugins which I use
* A way to basically let new programmers know which libraries they **should** use (anything in the Dependencies.scala)
* logback + resource files for most scala projects

To use 

```shell
g8r hjast/uberSBT
cd uberSBT
sbt
gen-idea
//Open up in IntelliJ
````

To change dependencies either change in the Build.scala file. 
```scala
/** You can use any of the predefined dependencies or you can do traditional dep. adding **/
dependencies = Seq(lift.webkit, akka.actor, akka.camel)

```
or in build.sbt
``` scala
libraryDependencies ++= akka.all
```

To use console at sbt prompt

```scala
console-admin
```

Now anything added in AdminConsole can be called directly.
